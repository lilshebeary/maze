# maze
matter-js maze from js bootcamp by Stephen Grider

This was a fun project using the paper.js library to make a maze game on a canvas, 
when the game ends the gravity is disabled and the maze falls to the bottom
a new maze is generated every time and it can be easy or complex as it is dynamic.
